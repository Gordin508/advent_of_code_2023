This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). All solutions are provided as Python code, with a few also being also ported to Rust to benefit from its increased speed.

Almost none of these solutions are optimal. I neither optimized for lines of code nor for execution time.
